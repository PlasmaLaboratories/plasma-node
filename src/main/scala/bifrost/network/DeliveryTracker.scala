/**
  * This class tracks modifier statuses.
  * Modifier can be in one of the following states: Unknown, Requested, Received, Held, Invalid.
  * See ModifiersStatus for states description.
  * Modifiers in `Requested` state are kept in `requested` map containing info about peer and number of retries.
  * Modifiers in `Received` state are kept in `received` set.
  * Modifiers in `Invalid` state are kept in `invalid` set to prevent this modifier download and processing.
  * Modifiers in `Held` state are not kept in this class - we can get this status from object, that contains
  * these modifiers (History for PersistentNodeViewModifier, Mempool for EphemerealNodeViewModifier).
  * If we can't identify modifiers status based on the rules above, it's status is Unknown.
  *
  * In success path modifier changes his statuses `Unknown`->`Requested`->`Received`->`Held`.
  * If something went wrong (e.g. modifier was not delivered) it goes back to `Unknown` state
  * (if we are going to receive it in future) or to `Invalid` state (if we are not going to receive
  * this modifier anymore)
  * Locally generated modifiers may go to `Held` or `Invalid` states at any time.
  * These rules are also described in `isCorrectTransition` function.
  *
  * This class is not thread-save so it should be used only as a local field of an actor
  * and its methods should not be called from lambdas, Future, Future.map, etc.
