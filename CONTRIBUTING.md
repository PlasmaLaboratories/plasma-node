Getting Started
---------------
If you just want to talk to us or share thoughts you have regarding the project
* [Join our Slack](https://slackin-inviter.herokuapp.com/)

If you have played around with the client and found some issues that crashes the client, be sure to submit an [Issue](https://github.com/Topl/Project-Bifrost/issues)
* Make sure you have a GitHub account
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
    * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
    * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.


Improving and updating the [Wiki](https://github.com/Topl/Project-Bifrost/wiki) is always welcomed. It is probably the easiest way to be involved with open-source development. Everyone will love you forever for doing this.

* Make sure you have a GitHub account
* `git clone https://github.com/Topl/Project-Bifrost.wiki.git`
* Create a new repository on your github account. Let's call it "Project-Bifrost-Wiki".
* Remove the original "origin" remote and add your github repo as new "origin" `git remote rm origin` and `git remote add origin git@github.com:<YOUR_USERNAME>/Project-Bifrost-Wiki.git`
* Make your proposed changes locally, then push them to your github account: `git push -u origin master` (`-u origin master` only required the first time; afterwards just do `git push`)
* Submit a ticket to our Github issue tracker requesting maintainers to review your changes and merge them in. Please be sure to include a link to your repo and describe what you've changed.

Making Changes
--------------

* Fork the repository to your Github account.
    * This is usually the master branch.
    * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that branch.
* Make commits.
* Make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Run all the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your pull request messages are in the proper format.
