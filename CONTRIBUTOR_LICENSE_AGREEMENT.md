# Contributor License Agreement

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Topl LLC ("Topl") and the Contributor ("You", "Your", etc.) agree to the terms herein. This license is for Your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Topl; it does not change Your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to Topl. Except for the license granted herein to Topl and recipients of software distributed by Topl, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1. **Definitions**

“Code” means the computer software code, whether in human-readable or machine-executable form, that is submitted by You to Topl under this Agreement.

“Project” means any of the projects owned or managed by Topl, of which all or any part of the source code may be distributed or made available.

“Submission” means the Code and any other copyrightable material Submitted by You, including any associated comments and documentation.

“Submit” is the act of uploading, transmitting, or distributing code or other content to any Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of discussing and improving that Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Submission.”

"You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Topl. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

2. **Submission.** In submitting Code or other content to any Topl Project, You express Your assent to all terms of this Agreement.

3. **Copyright License.** You grant Topl a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license in the Submission to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and sell, or otherwise distribute, the Submission and such derivative works, and to sublicense, through any terms that may be decided by Topl, any or all of the foregoing rights to third parties.

4. **Patent License.** You grant Topl, and those to whom Topl may extend sublicenses, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under Your patent claims that are necessarily infringed by the Submission or the combination of the Submission with the Project to which it was Submitted to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and import or otherwise dispose of the Submission alone or with the Project.

5. **Right to Submit.** You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work or that You have secured permission from Your employer to make the Submission in cases where Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for Your employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law.

6. **No Warranties.** All submissions are provided by You "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement. In no event shall you be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or the use or other dealings in the software.

7. **Notice.** You agree to notify Topl in writing of any facts or circumstances of which You later become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.

8. **Governing Law / Jurisdiction.** Any action or suit relating to this Agreement may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein Topl resides or conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.

9. **Entire Agreement / Assignment.** This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings or communications, written or oral, between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be assigned by Topl.
